Any installation or use of the SDK in the name of a company or other organization represents and warrants that the person doing so is authorized to legally bind You (as defined below) to this Agreement.
 
What is the SDK? The Philips Pathology Software Development Kit is a set of development tools and accompanying Documentation designed to make image- and meta-data stored in the Philips’ proprietary iSyntax format accessible (“SDK”). It is made available for academic research and non-commercial purposes only. It aims at enabling You to create programs that can interact with the data stored in iSyntax images and includes operating system specific libraries in Object Code and bindings for multiple programming languages.

Definitions.
"Documentation" means all materials (documentation, user guide, release notes, comments, annotations, instructions, manuals, and other written materials, whether in printed or electronic form, this License Agreement),, which are supplied as part of the SDK even if any part of these materials are made separately available online on the Philips web pages. 

“Object Code” means all or any portion of the machine-readable or machine language version of the SDK
